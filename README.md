Instruction for testing portfolio template:

1. For testing the template please download "temp1" not "tempHomepage", just ignore "tempHomepage".

2. Please clone 'faker' into your file:
     npm install --save faker
   [remember to clone into the current running file]
   
   
3. Check wether you have "react-multi-carousel" in your "node_modules" before testing all code, as code can not      run without this package in "node_modules". If you do not have one please dowload from this branch and copy      into "node_modules"

Enjoying testing :)
